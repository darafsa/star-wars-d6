If the control roll exceeds the difficulty, the character gains an immediate bonus to his climbing/jumping roll. If the Jedi fails any Force skill roll, the power is not activated and the character is left to use his normal jumping ability (and there are certain situations where you can’t back out of a jump because your power failed). At the gamemaster’s discretion, a failed climbing/jumping roll might mean the Jedi fails to achieve the desired height or distance, fails to properly cushion his landing and suffers normal falling damage, or both.

If there is enough room, the character may try running before jumping. The character may add +5 to his skill total per round of the running start, up to a maximum of +10 (two rounds).
